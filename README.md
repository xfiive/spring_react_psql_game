In order to add a functioning music player to the game you will need to do the following:

1) Download those tracks that you consider necessary and place them in the folder at ‘frontend/checkers-frontend/public/music’, adding your tracks to the ‘music’ folder.
2) Then find the AudioPlayer service component at ‘frontend/checkers-frontend/src/components/AudioPlayer.js’, and in it update the tracks array ‘tracks’ .
3) Music is added in this format: ‘../../music/iron-man.mp3’, where {iron-man.mp3} is any name and format of your track.
